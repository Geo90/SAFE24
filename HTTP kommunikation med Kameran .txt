1.3 Terminology
- Action - An action is a task that can be performed by the Axis product. The action is initiated by an action rule. Examples:
record video, send e-mail, activate output port.
- Action rule - An action rule specifies how and when the Axis product should perform an action. Example: record video when
motion is detected outside office hours.
- Condition - An additional condition that must be fulfilled to trigger the action rule.
- Event - Event is used as a collective name for stateful and stateless events. Events are emitted when the Axis product detects an
occurrence of some kind, for example motion in the camera’s field of view or a signal from an I/O port. Events can be used in action
rules (as start event or condition) and in notification subscriptions.
- Fixed action - A fixed action runs during a fixed, predefined time. Depending on the action type, the length of time is defined by one
or more action parameters, by the length of the audio clip to be played or similar.
- Recipient - A recipient is a network resource that can receive data, for example video clips or notification messages. Examples:
network share, FTP server, email address.
- Stateful event - A stateful event is a property (a state variable) with a number of states. The event is always in one of its states.
- Example: The Motion Detection event is in state true when motion is detected and in state false when motion is not detected.
- Stateless event - A stateless event is a momentary occurrence (a pulse). Example: Storage device removed.
- Unlimited action - An unlimited action runs as long as all conditions are fulfilled.
- Start event - A condition that must be fulfilled to trigger the action rule. Called Trigger in the product’s webpages.
